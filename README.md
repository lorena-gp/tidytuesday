# #TidyTuesday

## What is it?

As detailed in the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project on GitHub, #TidyTuesday project is a weekly data project aimed at the `R` ecosystem and borne out of the `R4DS Online Learning Community` and the `R for Data Science` textbook.

An emphasis is placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `dplyr`, and other tools in the `tidyverse` ecosystem, though any other code-based methodology is welcome.
